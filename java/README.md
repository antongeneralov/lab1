#Lab 5 README

Leslie Jones-Dove and Anton Generalov

There are two physics mechanics that are implemented into our Lab 5 game.

First, Mario now has gravity when he jumps up into the air. This can be activated by pressing the UP arrow key. What happens is that Mario jumps up in the air with an initial velocity. As he keeps rising, his velocity decreases. Eventually, he starts falling down and his velocity increases until he hits a terminal velocity. Mario stops falling when he hits the ground.

Then, Mario has a bounciness mechanic. When Mario hits a spike ball, Mario will bounce off of the spike ball. This can be triggered by simply colliding with the spike ball (which triggers the bounciness mechanic).

All the other functionalities (rotation, pivot, scaling, visibility), should remain the same as the previous labs.



Mario got separated form his brother Luigi! How could this have happened?!
These two are inseparable!

Bowser is to blame. He got in mario's way and started menacing him by walking up and down
in a straight line very menacingly!

Your task is to navigate mario around Bowser in order to get to luigi.

You have 5 mushrooms to begin with. Every time you lose (i.e. run into Bowser), you'll lose a mushroom.
When you reach Luigi, you have won our game and will see a nice pop up!
Are you among the best of the best that can win this game without losing a single mushroom?

Play our game to find out!
